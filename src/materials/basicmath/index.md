# Math topics<br>for test preparation

The materials intent to cover basic math topics that you are expected to know and understand before certain tests.

**Work in progress!**

## Math topics for Test #2

- [Inverse of matrices](/materials/basicmath/inverse-mx.md)

## Math topics for Test #3

- [Inverse of matrices using Gauss-Jordan elimination](/materials/basicmath/inverse-mx-gj.md)
- [Eigenvalues and eigenvectors](/materials/basicmath/eigen.md)
- [Diagonalization of matrices](/materials/basicmath/diagonalization.md)
- [Orthogonal and orthonormal basis](/materials/basicmath/ortho.md)
- [Inverse functions](/materials/basicmath/inverse-fn.md)
- [Proving limits by definition](/materials/basicmath/limits.md)
